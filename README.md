P2P FILE SYSTEM
===============
[Challenge task](http://www.csg.uzh.ch/teaching/fs15/p2p/challenge.html) for the course Overlay Networks, Decentralized Systems and Their Applications (UZH, Sptring 2015).

## Description ##
Opens Source distributed file system built on top of [TomP2P](https://github.com/tomp2p/TomP2P) and [FuseJNA](https://github.com/EtiennePerot/fuse-jna). TomP2P is "a library and a distributed hash table (DHT) implementation which provides a decentralized key-value infrastructure for distributed applications" and FuseJNA is a set of Java bindings to [FUSE library](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)

## System requirements ##
Maven is needed to build jar.
Linux distribution running kernel 2.4.X+ and Java 6.
Also works on osX via [osxfuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/)

## How to run ##
Simply check out the code from repository and run `runner/mkjar.sh`. That will create the `p2pfs.jar` in `target` directory.
Further the jar can be executed as follows:

`java -jar p2pfs.jar mount-point [bootstrap-ip] [peer-number]`

`mount-point` have to be an empty directory,

`[bootstrap-ip]` is the ip of a master peer, if not defined then peer will start as a server

`[peer-number]` is used for local testing, when all peers share the same ip but listen to different ports.

Also, runner scripts can be used (located in `runner` directory):

`runner/standalone.sh mount-point [bootstrap-ip]` standard mode,

`runner/local-master.sh mount-point` to start a "server" and to run several additional peers:

`runner/local-additional.sh mount-point peer-number`.

In all scripts inside `runner` it is assumed that commands are run from the project root directory and that jar file is inside `target` directory. Simply removing `cd target` from runner scripts and copying them with the jar in the same directory will do the trick.

## How it works ##
The documentation for FuseJNA can be found on its github page, the particular details of TomP2P library could be known from numerous examples.

For more details, check wiki.
